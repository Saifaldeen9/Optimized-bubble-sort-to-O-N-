# Optimized-bubble-sort-to-O-N-
Optimized bubble sort algorithm with time complexity of O(N)
The concept behind that is using of the infinite loop and the termination condition, when the pointer index n+1 reachs the end of array and without swapping flag indicated. 
Reset the indexes pointers when they reach the end of the array so that to start over again if still not sorted 
Comparing the values in n > n+1 => turn then swap
Increase the n and n+1 pointers
